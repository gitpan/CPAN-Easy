# NAME

CPAN::Easy - Easily look up and retrieve distributions from the CPAN

# SYNOPSIS

    use CPAN::Easy;

    # get a tarball and info given a module in that dist...
    my $tarball = CPAN::Easy->get_dist_for('MooseX::MarkAsMethods');

    # get info about a dist given a module in that dist...
    my $info = CPAN::Easy->get_dist('MooseX::MarkAsMethods');

    # ...etc

# DESCRIPTION

__This is VERY early code.  Its interface is liable to change until the first
non-developer release hits the CPAN.__

CPAN::Easy is a very small, simple module with a very small, simple goal: take
as much pain as possible out of interfacing with the CPAN in certain ways:

    * looking up what distribution a module belongs to,
    * getting some detailed information from a distribution, and
    * fetching tarballs.

To this end, we use Tatsuhiko Miyagawa's most excellent
CPAN Meta DB <http://cpanmetadb.appspot.com>, as well as a number of CPAN/URI
helper packages, and, of course, Moose.  (This is simple, not
as-lightweight-as-humanly-possible.)

We also function as a class package.  That is, all attributes and "methods"
should be interfaced to via the package name (e.g. the SYNOPSIS above).

We die on any and all errors.

# ATTRIBUTES

All attributes are coercive.

## verbose (boolean)

Determines how chatty we are.  Set to 0 for no output at all; 1 for some light
output.

## cpan_meta (URI)

Location of the CPAN Meta DB; you almost certainly don't want to change this.

Defaults to http://cpanmetadb.appspot.com/v1.0/package/.

## cpan_base (URI)

The "base" of all tarball URIs.

Defaults to http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/.

## fetch_to (Path::Class::Dir)

This is where CPAN::Easy will fetch any tarballs.

Defaults to .cpaneasy under File::HomeDir->my_data; for all practical purposes
on a *nix box this equates to "$ENV{HOME}/.cpaneasy/".

# CLASS FUNCTIONS

## get_info(<module name>)

Given a module name, return a hash containing: distfile, version, and
distinfo; where distfile like "R/RO/ROODE/Readonly-1.03.tar.gz", and distinfo
is a [CPAN::DistnameInfo](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?CPAN::DistnameInfo) object.

## get_dist_for(<module name)

Given a module name, look up the dist to which it belongs and fetch it.

## get_info_and_dist_for(<module name>)

Given a module name, look up the dist to which it belongs and fetch it.  We
return a list of the info ([CPAN::DistnameInfo](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?CPAN::DistnameInfo)) and the filename (expressed
as a [Path::Class::File](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Path::Class::File)).

## get_dist(<dist id>)

Given a dist id (e.g. "R/RO/ROODE/Readonly-1.03.tar.gz"), fetch it.

## get_meta_for(<module name>)

Given a module, attempt to pull its owning distribution's META.yml file from
the CPAN.  We return the parsed META.yml (a hashref).
